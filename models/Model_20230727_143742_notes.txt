#v0.2.1 you're going to load only the first 10 of the excitatory cells in the dataset class. 
#v0.3.1 added sag pool, extracted summed the sagpool scores to scoresum, added model save function with timestamp
#v0.4.1 added custom sag pool. See week 12 work notes for how to use. key feature: it returns an extra tensor with the complete sagpool scores.
#problem: pre_drop_score_sum collects scores from all epochs during trainging. We really only want the scores from the last epoch.
#v0.4.2 added total run time measurer
#0.5.2 testing last-epoch only score collector
#0.5.3 changed epoch runtime 
#0.6.3 added the scoresum collector
#0.6.4 fixed scoresum failing when run batch size != set batch_size (ie because num graphs not evenly divisible by batch_size)
#0.6.5 fixed epoch counter bug
#0.7.5 extracted scores with metadata and saved to csv
#0.7.5 fixed tensor size alignment issue with scoresum extraction tensor.size [n] != size [1,n]
#1.7.5 FULL RUN COMPLETE!
#1.8.5 added call rate counter, included it in model results, included weighted score in model results, renamed model results csv. Saved the 
#2.8.5 added two more convolution layers, two normalization layers, a dropout layer, and a second pooling layer. also softmaxxed the attention scores and took their product to output as the total graph attention score. 
#2.9.5 added a notes feature
#2.9.6 fixed misshape feed into sagpool caused by 2x attention heads and 2x hidden layer
#2.10.6 activated all changes from 1.8.5 to 2.9.6.
#2.11.6 added precision and f1 metrics. PROBLEM: IT ALWAYS PREDICTS THE SAME CLASS, sometimes 1, sometimes 0.
#2.11.7 changed adam lr to .0001 from .01.
#2.12.7 added the to.device() to accommodate gpu usage on hpc. model still runs on laptop
#2.12.9 changed a bunch of slashes around to keep the hpc happy
#2.12.11 more hpc grammar tweaks. script can't find pts/noedge_idx_0.pt
#2.13.11 added device checker that's called for main model only and goes to model_notes. 
#2.13.12 global variable for model_notes in the check_device function.


#testing notes
#t1: 10 cells loaded in dataset class with 50kb edge index w self loops. 
# Dataset definition bottleneck solved. You shouldn't include raw file names you can't use. 
# Performance is poor: only .4 acc on the test set.
#t2: v0.5.2, 100 cells loaded w 50kb self loop edge index
# runtime: ~5m per epoch, terminated after two epochs
# performance on two epochs: train acc: .6 test acc: .3
#t3: v1.8.5. 600s/epoch, 20ish mins(?) of class instantiation time
#t4: v1.8.5 all excitatory cells, left to run overnight. failed because of memory overallocation
#t5: v1.8.5 tried 20000 excitatory cells. failed because of memory overallocation. always step 1 of forward pass
#t6: v1.8.5 tried 10000 excitatory cells. failed because of memory allocation.
#t7: v1.8.5 tried 5000 excitatory cells. failed mem alloc. I think it's the batch size of 100, not the cell count. 
#t8: v1.8.5 tried 1000 exctatory cells, batch soze = 10. ran fine. total time 14k sec. test acc .63. scores ar weird-- top 1000 all sam score. 
#t9: v1.8.5 tried all excitatory cells, batch size = 10. 
#t10: v2.10.6 tried 1000 excitatory cells, batch size = 10. computer froze.
#t11: v2.10.6 rerun of t10
#t12: v2.11.6 run of 100 cells, batch = 10. need some data for the visualizer. cpu crash. lowering batchs size to 2. 
#t12: v2.11.6 run of 100 cells, batch = 2. no crash. still pred all the same values. 
#t12: v2.11.7 run of 1000, batch = 5. new adam value .0001 from .01. see if it fixes the pred same prob.
